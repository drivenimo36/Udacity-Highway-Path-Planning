# Path-Planning-Udacity
This is my solution to the Path Planning Project of the Udacity Self Driving Nanodegree.

The goal is to design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. This implementation succesfully keepts the vehicle inside its lane, avoids hitting other cars and changes lane if required using localization, sensor fusion and map data.

There are many approaches that can be used to generate paths.
In order to succesfully generate a path, smoothness and effectiveness has to be taken into account.
In this project, a system was designed to drive the car in a virtual
